# Heurist Integration Project

This project will act as a focussed pilot of a strategy for mitigating the
institutional risk posed by humanities collections currently in Heurist, by
demonstrating the ability to migrate them to a format which preserves their
scholarship and which is accessible without major software dependencies. The
project will migrate a significant humanities data collection from the Heurist
platform to a file-based format based on linked data standards and principles,
and make it available as part of the Language Data Commons of Australia
(LDaCA). Migrating the collection will allow the work done in Heurist to be
brought into a wider humanities data commons, opening it up to tools developed
as part of the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) and will leverage
existing work from that project, LDaCA and the Time Layered Cultural Map to
provide discovery and exploration interfaces. The technical approach is an
incremental step towards a future state with a modular architecture in which
separate use cases such as data description, storage and discovery are handled
by separate software components which can be maintained and updated more easily
than a single complex system. Tooling and standards developed as part of this
project will be made available as part of the HASS and Indigenous Research
Commons and the Community Data Lab.
